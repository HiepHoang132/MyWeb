        <p>
            Yogurt is fairly easy to make at home and the result is much better in 
            flavor and consistency than most commercial yogurt. You'll save money
            making your own, and also be able to choose what does or doesn't go into
            your yogurt (commercial brands often include thickeners and other non-dairy
            ingredients).
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 quart/1 liter milk</li>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons yogurt (with active cultures: all commercial brands
                will state on the container if the yogurt contains active cultures.)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to Make It</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Gently heat the milk over medium-low heat until it reaches 180oF/ 82oC
                Turn off the head and the milk cool down to between 106oF/41oC and 110oF/43oC
            </li>
            <li>
                While the heated milk is cooling, wash the jars and leave them filled with
                hot water so the glass will be warm when you add the yogurt.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the milk has cooled enough, warm a large bowl or measuring cup by filling
                it with hot water. Empty out the water. Strain the milk through a fine mesh strainer
                into the warmed bowl. Whisk in the yogurt. Pour out the water in the jars and pour in the 
                milk plus yogurt mixture. Fasten the lids.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the jars in a warm but not hot palce where they can remain undisturbed for 8 hours
                or overnight. An old fashioned oen in which the pilot light is always on is perfect. So is an 
                oven with the light turned on but the head off. Another option is a food dehydrator set to 
                110oF/43oC with the trays removed to make room for the jars. Or you could buy a speical yogurt
                maker that maintains the ideal temperature,
            </li>
            <li>
                Be careful <b><i>not</i></b> to jostile the jars while the active yogurt cultures are working
                on the milk. Yogurt is very finicky about this, and will sometimes not set up well if the jars 
                are removed during this period.
            </li>
            <li>Tansfer the jars to the refrigerator</li>
        </ol>
